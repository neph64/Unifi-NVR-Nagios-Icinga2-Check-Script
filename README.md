# Unifi-NVR-Nagios-Icinga2-Check-Script
A small script that can be used to check the Unifi NVRs for camera connectivity, hard drive status, CPU temp, and camera firmware status. Use at your own risk. The script is provided with no warranty or support. It was just a quick project that I figured I would share.
